# Android CMP TEST APP

This is a test app to show how to integrate the CMP widget framework into an application.

# Quickstart

```bash

# Test button functions
Summon CMP --> Shows CMP **IF** the cmp did not show
Modify Consent --> Brings up CMP for changes
Clear TCString --> Deletes the stored TCString from shared prefernces
```

# Architecture

Super basic example. Not much architecture other then connecting the functions in ViewController to the UIButtons in the storyboard. It's a good starter step to getting an app created using our CMP.
